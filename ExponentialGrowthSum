Iteration 1: (i = 0)
Calculation: math.Exp(float64(0)) computes

 =1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).
Sum: The sum is initialized at 0, so after this iteration, the sum is 
0

1
=
1
0+1=1.
Iteration 2: (i = 1)
Calculation: math.Exp(float64(1)) computes 
𝑒

 ≈2.71828.
Sum: After this iteration, the sum is 
1
+
2.71828
≈
3.71828
1+2.71828≈3.71828.
Iteration 3: (i = 2)
Calculation: math.Exp(float64(2)) computes 
𝑒

 ≈7.38906.
Sum: After this iteration, the sum is 
3.71828
